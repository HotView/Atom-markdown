## 绘制关键点
cv2.drawKeypoints(image, keypoints[, outImage[, color[, flags]]]) $\rightarrow$  outImage
==Parameters  ==
- ==image== – Source image.  
- ==keypoints== – Keypoints from the source image.  
- outImage – Output image. Its content depends on the flags value defining what is drawn in the output image. See possible flags bit values below.  
- ==color== – Color of keypoints.  
- ==flags== – Flags setting drawing features. Possible flags bit values are defined by DrawMatchesFlags. See details above in drawMatches() .
## 一对一绘制
cv2.drawMatches(img1, keypoints1, img2, keypoints2, matches1to2[, outImg[, matchColor[, singlePointColor[, matchesMask[, flags]]]]]) $\rightarrow$ outImg
==Parameters==
- **img1** – First source image.
- **keypoints1** – Keypoints from the first source image.
- **img2** – Second source image.
- **keypoints2** – Keypoints from the second source image.
- **matches1to2** – Matches from the first image to the second one, which means that keypoints1[i] has a corresponding point in keypoints2[matches[i]] .
- **outImg** – Output image. Its content depends on the flags value defining what is drawn in the output image. See possible flags bit values below.
- **matchColor** – Color of matches (lines and connected keypoints). If matchColor==Scalar::all(-1) , the color is generated randomly.
- **singlePointColor** – Color of single keypoints (circles), which means that keypoints do not have the matches. If singlePointColor==Scalar::all(-1) , the color is generated randomly.  
- **matchesMask** – Mask determining which matches are drawn. If the mask is empty, all matches are drawn.  
- **flags** – Flags setting drawing features. Possible flags bit values are defined by DrawMatchesFlags.
